We present a draft sequence of the Neandertal genome composed of more than 4 billion nucleotides from three individuals. Comparisons of the Neandertal genome to the genomes of five present-day humans from different parts of the world identify a number of genomic regions that may have been affected by positive selection in ancestral modern humans, including genes involved in metabolism and in cognitive and skeletal development. We show that Neandertals shared more genetic variants with present-day humans in Eurasia than with present-day humans in sub-Saharan Africa, suggesting that gene flow from Neandertals into the ancestors of non-Africans occurred before the divergence of Eurasian groups from each other.},

\begin{myabstract}
There\marginnote{Abstract\\(in French see below)} has been a veritable explosion of archaeogenetic studies after the Human Genome was published in 2010. Among such studies, the sequencing of the Neanderthal genome provided new insight into human evolution and the past relationships between Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis, even providing evidence for interbreeding. With an average of \SIrange[range-phrase=--]{2}{3}{\percent} of genes considered to originate from the Neanderthal line being present in Europeans, and current estimates of up to \SI{20}{\percent} Neanderthal contribution to the human genome, there has been a reconsideration of what makes us human. This paper presents a discussion of group and individual constructions of identity in an archaeogenetic world, using selected reactions to Neanderthal Genome Project and the Genographic Project by the general public as case studies.
